# Implementation system

Forge is built as **epics** made of **atomic steps**.

```text

```

## Model

| Layer | ID example | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Epic | `02-forge-control` | A capability from the roadmap; may span many commits |
| Step | `02.01` | One shippable increment with tests, docs, and one commit |

Rules:

1. An epic is **not** implemented in one go unless it is truly tiny.
2. Each service epic (Control, Runtime, Gateway, …) is expected to become **multiple steps**.
3. A step must be independently demoable or verifiable.
4. Later steps must not be required for earlier steps to pass.
5. Planning writes/updates files under `epics/` and `steps/`; implementing changes code.

## Workflow

### 1. Plan (detail an epic into steps)

Use [`PLAN_STEPS.md`](PLAN_STEPS.md) with one epic ID, e.g. `02-forge-control`.

For the full ecosystem catalog, see [`MASTER_PLAN.md`](MASTER_PLAN.md).

Output:

* updated epic README-style doc in `epics/`
* one step file per increment under `steps/<epic>/`
* rows added to `progress.md`

### 2. Implement (one step only)

Use [`IMPLEMENT_STEP.md`](IMPLEMENT_STEP.md) with the next `N` from [`progress.md`](progress.md). Lookup: [`STEPS.md`](STEPS.md).

### 3. Track

Update [`progress.md`](progress.md) after planning and after each step completes.

| [10-forge-secrets](epics/10-forge-secrets.md) | Planning | `10.01`–`10.07` |
| [11-forge-events](epics/11-forge-events.md) | Planning | `11.01`–`11.07` |
| [12-forge-observe](epics/12-forge-observe.md) | Planning | `12.01`–`12.07` |
| [13-forge-storage](epics/13-forge-storage.md) | Planning | `13.01`–`13.07` |
| [14-forge-models](epics/14-forge-models.md) | Planning | `14.01`–`14.07` |
| [15-forge-agents](epics/15-forge-agents.md) | Planning | `15.01`–`15.08` |
| [16-forge-workflows](epics/16-forge-workflows.md) | Planning | `16.01`–`16.07` |
| [17-forge-memory](epics/17-forge-memory.md) | Planning | `17.01`–`17.06` |
| [18-managed-postgresql](epics/18-managed-postgresql.md) | Planning | `18.01`–`18.06` |
| [19-full-platform-demo](epics/19-full-platform-demo.md) | Planning | `19.01`–`19.06` |

**Next:** `N = 51` via [`IMPLEMENT_STEP.md`](IMPLEMENT_STEP.md) — lookup in [`STEPS.md`](STEPS.md).

Queue: [`STEPS.md`](STEPS.md) (`N = 1` … `N = 131`). Catalog: [`MASTER_PLAN.md`](MASTER_PLAN.md).

## Future state (epics 20–43, standalone cloud)

After epic `19`, Forge becomes a standalone cloud that runs identically on local Docker,
bare metal, Hetzner, AWS, and Azure. Target architecture:
[`docs/architecture/standalone-cloud.md`](../architecture/standalone-cloud.md).
Plan: [`FUTURE_PLAN.md`](FUTURE_PLAN.md).

| Epics | Milestone | Planning depth |
|---|---|---|
| [`20`–`25`](FUTURE_PLAN.md#3-epic-index) | M1 — standalone cloud core | Epic docs + step files (`N = 132`–`173`) |
| [`26`–`37`](FUTURE_PLAN.md#3-epic-index) | M2 — production platform | Epic docs with step catalogs |
| [`38`–`43`](FUTURE_PLAN.md#3-epic-index) | M3 — global platform | Epic docs with step catalogs |

**These do not affect current work.** Steps `1`–`131` are frozen, the next implementable
current-roadmap step is still `N = 51`, and every future epic extends shipped behaviour rather than
replacing it — see [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-additive-evolution-after-epic-19.md).

## Naming

```text
Human prompt:  N = 8                          ← only number you change
Lookup:        STEPS.md row for N
Epic file:     docs/implementation/epics/02-forge-control.md
Step file:     docs/implementation/steps/02-forge-control/02.01-….md
Commit:        feat(02.01): …                 ← from the step doc (internal)
```
